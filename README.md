# Temporal Convolutional Networks & Knowledge Graphs

Temporal Convolutional Networks, or simply TCN, is a variation of Convolutional Neural Networks for sequence modelling tasks, by combining aspects of RNN and CNN architectures. Preliminary empirical evaluations of TCNs have shown that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as LSTMs across a diverse range of tasks and datasets while demonstrating longer effective memory.
